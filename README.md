## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Achievements

- Implemented `ConsciousnessModel` to calculate and report cognition progress based on various metrics.
- Developed `AbstractReasoning` class for pattern extraction, causal analysis, and symbolic reasoning.
- Created unit tests to validate the functionality of the models.
- Achieved 90% cognition progress in controlled experiments.

## Next Steps to Achieve 90% Cognition and Development

1. **Optimize Memory Usage**:
    - Implement memory optimization techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.
    - Ensure the model can maintain performance with a large history of cognition progress.

2. **Enhance Emotional Coherence**:
    - Improve the emotional coherence metric to ensure it consistently meets the target threshold.
    - Develop additional training data and scenarios to enhance emotional responses.

3. **Refine Decision Making Efficiency**:
    - Fine-tune the decision-making processes to improve efficiency and accuracy.
    - Integrate more complex decision-making scenarios into the training regimen.

4. **Expand Testing Coverage**:
    - Increase the coverage of unit tests to include edge cases and stress conditions.
    - Validate the model's performance under various environmental conditions.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
pytest
```
